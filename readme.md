# C# Study Base

Welcome to the C# study base, a collection of documentation, books, and courses to help you learn and improve your C# programming skills. This README will guide you through the different resources available and how to use them.

## Documentation

The official documentation for C# can be found at the Microsoft C# Language Reference website: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/. This website contains detailed documentation on the C# language, including syntax, concepts, and examples.

## Study method

I will use some ways to deep dive in .NET, for example, study with:

- Documentation (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp)
- Courses (https://techguide.sh/pt-BR/path/)
- .NET Notebooks (dib)

# Conclusion

I hope in one year, do awesome backend projects with C#.

If you want to learn, remember to practice regularly and experiment with different code snippets to gain a deeper understanding of the language.
